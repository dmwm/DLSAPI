The code in the DLS cvs module is related to the
Data Location Service (DLS). Please check the
DLS Twiki at:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/DLS

The code in this module includes a protype DLS
server and API/CLI clients for this and other
types of DLS servers (with different external
back-ends). There is also testing code and
documentation.

Please, always refer to the aforementioned
Twiki, which should give you more
up-to-date information (including which type
of client you need to use).

The most used client today (Feb 2008) is the  
DBS-based. PhEDEx-based should become relevant
in the near future. Client code for both is
totally contained within the DLS/Client/LFCClient/
subdirectory, so you will be probably interested
in checking the README file therein.

The instructions that follow indicate how to
use the old MySQL-based DLS prototype.
For client installations use the Makefile
under DLS/Client or DLS/Client/LFCClient/, 
but note that this not include any setup
of possible dependencies.


#================================================
#   DLS Server Prototype 0 (Giovanni Ciraolo)   #
#================================================
# Sever code:
 Server/SimpleServer/
# Client code:
 Client/SimpleClient/

Ver 0.0:
* Support up to 120 Thread
* Transacion support
* Easy Installation Tool

INSTALLATION:

 1. Requirements

   * mysql server ver>= 4.0.1
   * MySQL-python-1.2.0
   * Mysql Administration privileges

 This create and populate  new Mysql dls database with user 'dls' indentified by password 'dls'

 3. Start a dls server

 Server/SimpleServer/dls-server  --host localhost --host_db localhost --user dls --passwd dls --database dls --num_thread 2

 This start a dls server with 2 Client Thread on default port 18080
 

EXAMPLES from a client:                                                                                                 
- Add a Replica:

 dls-add-replica --host localhost --datablock datablock1 --se grid001.fi.infn.it --port 18080

- Show list of datablocks  in grid001.fi,infn.it :

 dls-get-datablock --se grid001.fi.infn.it --host localhost

- Show list of se that stores datablock1 :

 dls-get-se --datablock datablock1 --host localhost

- Remove a replica:

 dls-remove-replica --host localhost --datablock datablock1 --se grid001.fi.infn.it --port 18080
